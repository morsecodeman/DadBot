# DadBot

A really dumb Discord bot with no commands.  
It does two things; reply with "Hi {}, I'm Dad!" and change the user's nickname to {}.

## Usage

Create a `config.py` in the bot directory, assign your token (string) as `TOKEN`, and run `bot.py`.

## Requirements

- Python 3.6+
- [discord.py](https://github.com/Rapptz/discord.py)
